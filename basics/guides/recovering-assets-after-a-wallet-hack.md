# Recovering Assets After a Wallet Hack

At Eonian, we prioritize your security and peace of mind. If your wallet is compromised, we've streamlined a process to help you recover your assets. Follow these steps carefully to speed up the recovery process.

## Immediate Reporting

As soon as you detect unauthorized activity or believe your wallet has been hacked, report the incident immediately.

### How to Report

Send an email to [care@eonian.finance](mailto:care@eonian.finance) from the email address that you linked to your wallet during the deposit process. In your report, include the following:

* **Your Wallet Address -** The address of the compromised wallet.
* **New Wallet Address -** The address of the new wallet that you trust and to which we can transfer your assets.
* **Incident Details -**A brief description of what happened, including the time and nature of the breach.
* **Additional Information -** Any relevant wallet logs or screenshots that can assist in the investigation.

Reporting as soon as possible increases the likelihood of recovering your assets. The quicker we receive your report, the faster we can react and lock your savings account from the compromised wallet.

## Loss Prevention Measures

Once you've reported the hack, we will take immediate steps to secure your remaining assets.

If your assets are still present in the compromised wallet, we will lock them to prevent any further unauthorized transactions. This lock will remain in place throughout the investigation.

## Submit Required Evidence

Depending on the specifics of the hack, we may request further documentation or evidence. We may need to perform KYC to verify that the email is still linked to the real owner of the assets. Gather anything that you are able to and submit the necessary documentation to support the investigation.

The more evidence you can provide, the faster it will be for us to validate your claim.

## Assets Transfer

If all your assets are in a savings account and no reimbursement is needed, we follow the simplified process to speed up the investigation. Usually, we will just approve the transfer with some delay to be sure that the real owner of the assets has enough time to alert us in case of an email hack.&#x20;

Assets will stay in place in your savings account as long as they need to, and we cannot transfer these assets without the owner's asking.&#x20;

The next steps apply only if you need reimbursement for stolen assets.

## **Investigation Phase**

If you reported that your wallet was hacked after a hacker used it to withdraw assets from your savings account, we will perform an investigation process of claim to pay reimbursement for hacked assets. We may ask for additional information at this stage.

After submitting your claim and evidence, our team will begin a thorough investigation. Our investigation and security team will perform:

* **Evidence Review -** We examine the details you’ve provided to verify the legitimacy of the hack.
* **Involvement of Experts -** If necessary, we may collaborate with blockchain detectives or community members to investigate the breach.
* **Community Participation -** In complex cases, we may involve our DAO for voting on the case. Participants in the voting process could receive rewards from the reimbursement pool.

The investigation’s duration depends on the complexity of the case and the quality of evidence provided. We aim to conduct a thorough yet efficient review to reach a fair decision.

## Reimbursement Claim Approval

Based on the result of the investigation, we will either approve or move the vote for the final decision to our DAO community.&#x20;

* Approval - If the evidence strongly supports that the hack was genuine and not linked to user error or misuse, we will approve your claim reimbursement.
* Denial - If, in ambiguous situations, we find that the hack is linked to the user or if there’s insufficient evidence to support the claim and the community votes against approval, the claim may be denied.&#x20;

## Payment of Recovered Assets

Upon claim approval, we will initiate the transfer of the recovered assets to your specified wallet.

* **Payout Timeline -** The payment process time varies based on the size of the claim. Larger claims may take longer due to additional verification steps.
* **Final Step -** You will receive your recovered assets in the wallet address provided. We recommend double-checking the wallet address before finalizing the claim to ensure accuracy.
