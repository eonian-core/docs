# Savings Premium

The majority of revenue generated from investment protocols is used to pay and fill the insurance pool, but when the insurance pool is bigger than the need to cover usersâ€™ assets, the revenue is redistributed back to users as a savings premium. This allows users to not only save their assets but also grow them while they are holding them.

This savings premium is dynamically adjusted based on the amount of liquidity in the Vault, the insurance pool, and the market risk situation.

Our early-access users and beta testers get a higher premium as a reward for their involvement.
