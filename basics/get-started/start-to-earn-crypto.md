# ðŸ¤— How to Deposit Crypto

To insure your savings, you first need to deposit your crypto into the Eonian protocol. This way, you will save it in insured storage, which generates interest on your savings. After completing this guide, you will be able to enable insurance for deposited assets.

## **Go to Eonian**

### Visit [the Eonian protocol](https://eonian.finance/) website.

After the successful deposit of your tokens, Eonian takes the lead. Your tokens will strategically lend your assets in various DeFi protocols, yielding returns over time. You can see projected returns on the right chart.

### Enable Insurance

Now, you need to enable wallet insurance by linking your email. As a result, if someone hacks your wallet, you will be able to recover access to your wallet through email or get reimbursement if a hacker is able to steal your assets.
