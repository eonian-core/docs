## The Ambassador Roles

Embark on a path of distinction with the Eonian Ambassador Roles. These roles are titles and testament to your impact and commitment within the Eonian community. Designed to acknowledge and celebrate your contributions, Ambassador Roles are a mark of honor, symbolizing both your achievements and the trust placed in you by the community.

As an Eonian Ambassador, you are not just participating; you are leading and shaping the future of our community. Each role signifies a higher level of influence and accomplishment, making them highly prestigious and sought-after. They serve not only to recognize your dedication but also to inspire and guide newer members, setting the standard for what it means to be an integral part of the Eonian community.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Eonian Ambassador roles are commonly referred to in crypto as **OG roles**. Even the entry-level role guarantees token retrodrop. However, a higher role will result in a higher number of tokens.

On top of that, they can be earned together with [Community roles](../the-community-roles/), which can also be referred to as **OG roles**.&#x20;

#### **Starting with Entry-Level**

Embarking on your ambassador journey is seamless with our Entry-Level role. This initial step is your gateway to showcasing your skills and choosing your path of growth. Once you attain this role, youâ€™re already on the board for the retrodrop. Each interaction, quest, and conversation in our community bolsters your rewards and propels you towards higher ranks of prestige.

#### **Three Directions, Three Levels**

Our program offers three distinct growth paths, each with three levels to ascend. The Middle-Level roles are permanent and automatically assigned based on your quest completions in Zealy. As you advance, the Senior-Level roles will be assigned by our community management team. They bring you monthly Zealy XP rewards. The higher you climb, the greater the XP you accumulate.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Stay Active, Stay Recognized**: To maintain your rank, especially at the senior ambassador levels, active participation is key. Inactivity, inappropriate behavior, or cheating can lead to demotion one level lower. Your continuous engagement and contributions are essential to upholding your esteemed status within the Eonian community.
