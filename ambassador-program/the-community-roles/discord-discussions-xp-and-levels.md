# ðŸ’¬ Discord Discussions XP and Levels

The Discussions XP system serves a dual purpose: motivating and rewarding users for their contributions to the community while also recognizing the most active participants for their involvement.

## **Earning** Discussions **XP for chatting**

Users have the opportunity to earn XP by participating in discussions on the Discord server. For every minute you actively engage in conversation, you'll receive a random XP reward, depending on the length and quality of your messages. To maintain fairness and discourage message spamming for XP farming, there is a cooldown period of 1 minute. This means you can earn XP once every minute.

{% hint style="warning" %}
In cases where a user is found to be in violation of rules by engaging in XP farming or system exploitation, decisive measures can be implemented, including a decrease in XP and bans.
{% endhint %}

## **What are The Community Roles**

[The Community Roles](https://app.gitbook.com/o/xgYiQpRVz9aTVJOJJ1bx/s/VE523Jodte4jjJfssUo3/\~/changes/1/ambassador-program/the-community-roles) represent unique server designations within the Eonian community, automatically assigned to users based on their attained levels. These roles have been introduced to celebrate the achievements of our members and provide recognition as they advance through the levels by earning XP.

## **Leveling Up**

Earning Discussions XP results in a higher level. The Discussions XP required to progress to the next level increases as users advance through the levels.

As members level up, they will automatically acquire community roles. These special roles were designed to recognize and reward our active supporters. Our bot will assign these roles based on your current level.

More info about community roles can be found there ðŸ‘‡.
