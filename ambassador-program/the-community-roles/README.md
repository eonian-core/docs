# ðŸ¤— The Community Roles

Welcome to the realm of Eonian Community Roles, where your active participation and contributions are not just recognized but celebrated. These roles arenâ€™t just titles; they're milestones on your journey with us, each unlocking new avenues of rewards and recognition. As you climb the ranks, you collect Zealy XP, paving your way to exclusive rewards in the upcoming Eonian project token retrodrop.

Each role within our community carries its unique prestige and privileges, symbolizing your growing influence and dedication through a unique badge that is displayed next to your username. So, everyone will know your status in the community!

{% hint style="info" %}
The Eonian Community roles are commonly referred to in crypto as **OG roles**. Even the lowest role guarantees token retrodrop. However, a higher role will result in a higher number of tokens.&#x20;

On top of that, they can be earned together with [Ambassador roles](../the-ambassador-roles/), which are also **OG roles**. However, they provide additional benefits, including an increase in the number of tokens monthly.

### **Ways to Earn Community Roles**

These community roles are permanent and usually rewarded automatically. Here's how you can rise through the ranks and make your mark in the Eonian community.

* **Engage in Discord Discussions -** Your voice in our Discord matters. By engaging in conversations, you accumulate [Discord Discussions XP](https://app.gitbook.com/o/xgYiQpRVz9aTVJOJJ1bx/s/VE523Jodte4jjJfssUo3/\~/changes/1/ambassador-program/page-1/discord-discussions-xp-and-levels). Each new level attained brings a role that reflects your evolving status.
* **Expand Our Community -** Bring your friends into the Eonian Discord server. The more people you invite, the higher your rank climbs. Discover more about our [Discord Invites System](https://app.gitbook.com/o/xgYiQpRVz9aTVJOJJ1bx/s/VE523Jodte4jjJfssUo3/\~/changes/1/ambassador-program/page-1/discord-invites-system) and start growing your network.
* **Contribute Actively -** Your ideas, feedback, and participation in events don't go unnoticed. Our community managers are always on the lookout to reward members who consistently add value and vibrancy to our community.

Attaining a specific role is flexible â€“ you can reach it either through discussion engagement or invites. No need to fulfill both criteria.
