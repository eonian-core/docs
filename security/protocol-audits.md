# ðŸ“‘ Audits

Security is critical for us, which is why we need to ensure that our smart contract code doesn't contain any vulnerabilities, exploits, or security issues.  We perform different automated checks through linters and code analyzers for our codebase on each update. You can read about it there:

{% endcontent-ref %}

Additionally, we plan to validate each significant smart contract protocol change through third-party audit firms.  Starting from the first audit performed before our public beta release.

## Audits

First quick check audit of our protocol that was performed by [TechRate ](https://techrate.org/)before our public beta release:

## Vertical Audits

Our team also performs independent audits on other protocols before we integrate with them:
