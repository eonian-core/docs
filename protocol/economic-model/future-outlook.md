# Future Outlook

While the insurance pool can maintain positive returns and grow by itself over time, it may not be enough in case of the rapid growth of protocol TVL. To cover such cases, in the future, we will be able to provide access to an insurance pool for liquidity providers more tailored to risks. They will be able to invest in a liquidity pool and receive part of the revenue that it generates.

This way, the insurance pool/TVL ratio can be balanced by regular market conditions of supply and demand.
