# Closed Beta Test

After addressing all major issues during **the alpha test** and rolling out multiple advanced strategies, we expect to offer stable and high APY at the start of the closed beta test. While our protocol's safety level will match other yield aggregators, we aim to go above and beyond.

## During the Closed Beta Test

The closed beta test will last approximately 2-3 months. During this time, we'll introduce major security solutions to address potential issues and vulnerabilities that might arise in the future. For instance, we'll implement a system to prevent liquidations during investment strategy operations.

After the protocol is safe enough to handle a large amount of value, we will transition to a public beta test.

## Beta Tester Benefits

To join the beta, you'll need to fill out a form that we'll release later. All beta testers will receive similar benefits to **alpha testers**, except for a smaller token allocation during the retrodrop and increased competition for Vault Founders Tokens. Here's a list of benefits:

* 📉 Lower protocol fees - 15% during the beta test (compared to 20% after launch), so you keep 85% of the profit generated by investment strategies!
* 💰 Retrodrop - Receive our DAO token upon release, enabling you to participate in DAO governance and earn passive income. We'll share more details and tokenomics closer to the token release.
* 🏆 Vault Founders Tokens - Earn passive income forever with these unique, non-transferable tokens. Vault Founders token is a specific achievement given to people who were one of the first who deposited a significant amount of tokens in Vault. In reward for the founders’ early help, Vault pays them 1% of the total profit, which Vault investment strategies generate. You can read more about Vault Founders Tokens **here**.

## Beta Tester Limits

We'll grant access to the closed beta test for 200 people. Since 100 alpha testers will automatically transition to the beta test, only 100 additional spots will be available.

## **Expectations from Beta Testers**

While all major issues will be closed during the alpha test, and many advanced strategies will generate rewards for them for some time. We want to test how stable these rewards generate and improve the safety of their workflow.

We expect beta testers to report any issues, bugs, or usability problems that hinder depositing or withdrawing investments, such as missing information or unclear deposit workflows. You can share your feedback in our [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/8mcUPPYJmj). We'll reward those who find real problems or offer valuable suggestions. 🏅
