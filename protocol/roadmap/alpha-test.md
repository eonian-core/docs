# Alpha Test

During the closed alpha test, we aim to identify critical bugs and potential issues in our protocol. Want to help? Join the waitlist by [filling out the form on our landing](https://eonian.finance/) and enjoy exclusive rewards 🎁 for your assistance!

## **What we have**

Initially, our protocol feature an automated investment strategy for a single stablecoin with regular APY. While our goal is to offer higher yields quickly, we prioritize careful development. The initial strategy poses minimal risks, cannot cause liquidation, and is based on the [**ApeSwap Lending protocol**](https://lending.apeswap.finance/). Our independent audit of ApeSwap Lending is available [**here**](https://www.notion.so/ApeSwap-Lending-Audit-Report-2c499edcbf0b432dbd94424268cf3a88?pvs=21). After the ApeSwap team resolved a [**critical issue**](https://www.notion.so/ApeSwap-Lending-Audit-Report-2c499edcbf0b432dbd94424268cf3a88?pvs=21) we discovered, we are confident in the protocol's security.

## Alpha Testers Benefits

After [**joining the waitlist**](https://rhetor.ai/EJF0BYU7), we'll notify you when the alpha test begins. We will give access to the alpha test only first 100 applicants. All alpha testers who deposit any amount into our Vaults enjoy great perks:

* 📉 Lower protocol fees - 15% during the alpha test (compared to 20% after full launch), so you keep 85% of the profit generated by investment strategies!
* 💰 Retrodrop - Receive our DAO token upon release, enabling you to participate in DAO governance and earn passive income. We'll share more details and tokenomics closer to the token release.
* 🏆 Vault Founders Tokens - Earn passive income forever with these unique, non-transferable tokens. Vault Founders token is a specific achievement, given to people who were one of the first who deposited a significant amount of tokens in Vault. In reward for the founders’ early help, Vault pays them 1% of the total profit, which Vault investment strategies generate.

## **Vault Founders Tokens Explained**

Vault Founders Tokens are soulbound tokens that grant you lifetime passive income. Soublound means these tokens a “bound” to the address that receives them and cannot be transferred. Here's the breakdown:

* Deposit tokens, for example USDT, into the protocol and receive a corresponding Vault Founder token, permanently assigned to your wallet. In our example, it will be the USDT Vault Founders token.
* To obtain a token, deposit more than the previous Vault Founder. Each subsequent token requires a 20% larger deposit. For example, if the last Founder deposited 1000 ETH in the ETH Vault, the next Founder must deposit 1200 ETH.
* Alpha testers will be among the first who deposit tokens in the protocol, which gives them an advantage in obtaining tokens at a lower price.
* Vault Founders receive 1% of the Vault's total profit forever. For example, if BTC Vault generates 10 000 BTC per year, BTC Vault Founders will receive a total of 100 BTC per year.
* Each Vault has its own Founders list (BTC, ETH, USDT, etc.) with a maximum of 100 Founders.
* It does not require for Founder to keep depositing crypto in Vault. It means that you can withdraw them anytime.

## During Alpha Test

> Planned until at least Q4 2023.

We will gradually release the following:

* 🚀 More advanced and profitable investment strategies.
* 🌐 New protocols for profit-generating strategies.
* 💱 Additionally, supported investment tokens.

We'll test strategies with our own tokens first and then release them to alpha testers once they're deemed safe. For us important to keep your funds secure.

When we will roll out all major strategies and will have enough stable and high APY, we will transition to the closed beta stage.

## **Expectations from Alpha Testers**

As the core of our protocol is to eliminate waste of time during investments, it is exactly what we want to test. We don't require much from alpha testers - simply deposit tokens, wait for rewards to accumulate, and withdraw when desired. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, let us know in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8mcUPPYJmj). We'll reward those who find real problems or offer valuable feedback. 🏅

💰 As an alpha tester, you should witness your balance grow as we roll out more profitable strategies. Just deposit, relax, and watch your investments grow! 🌱
