# Release v1

During previous stages, we aim to establish an exceptional level of safety and security in the industry. As we approach Release v1, we will expand the number of strategies, tokens, and investment protocols, positioning our platform as a leader in the yield aggregator space. 🌐

## **What to expect?**

The v1 Release will bring an array of new features and enhancements, which can be broadly classified into two major categories:

1. 🔐 **Security measures -** While safety always has room for improvement, some security systems require substantial development time. For the first major release, we have prepared sophisticated and hard-to-develop solutions that will set a new benchmark in the industry. This includes multi-signature wallets, time-locked contracts, and additional monitoring tools to ensure the utmost protection of our users' assets.
2. 💹 **Increased and stable APY -** Our goal is to offer a consistent 10% APY or higher for stablecoins and 4% APY for BTC/ETH. However, we understand that no single protocol can constantly generate these numbers. To achieve this, we will build our protocol on top of multiple other protocols, simultaneously refining and optimizing our strategies. This approach will enable us to provide diversified, high-performing, and stable investment options to our users.

## **Collaboration with external partners**

To ensure the success of the v1 Release, we will actively collaborate with external partners, including other DeFi projects, yield farming platforms, and industry experts. 🤝 This collaboration will enable us to leverage their expertise and insights, helping us fine-tune our strategies and expand our offerings. Our goal is to create a comprehensive and robust ecosystem that benefits all participants.

## **Education and community engagement**

As we move closer to the v1 Release, we will strengthen our focus on education and community engagement. 🎓 This includes creating educational content, hosting webinars, and offering tutorials to help users understand our platform, strategies, and the broader DeFi ecosystem. By empowering our users with knowledge and fostering a strong community, we aim to create a loyal and dedicated user base that actively contributes to the platform's success.

## **Roadmap and future plans**

The v1 Release marks a significant milestone for our project, but our journey doesn't end here. We will continue to innovate and enhance our platform, staying ahead of the ever-evolving DeFi landscape. 🚀 Our roadmap includes plans for integrating with additional blockchains, exploring new DeFi niches, and collaborating with traditional financial institutions to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized finance.

By the time of the v1 Release, we aim to achieve one of the highest APYs on the blockchain, and we will relentlessly work to improve and maintain this position. Together, let's build the future of decentralized finance! 💡
