# Public Beta Test

After addressing major vulnerabilities and achieving stable APY during the previous development phases, we will have reached a security level that surpasses many prominent yield aggregators, preparing our protocol to handle a larger amount of value. 🚀

## **During the Public Beta Test**

Throughout the public beta test, we will focus on expanding our offerings and enhancing the user experience:

1. 📈 **Adding investment protocols and strategies -** We will integrate additional investment protocols and strategies to provide users with more diversified and optimized opportunities for earning rewards.
2. 🔒 **Undergoing audits and strengthening safety systems -** To ensure the highest level of security, we will subject our protocol to rigorous audits by reputable firms and make any necessary enhancements to our safety systems.
3. 🖥️ **Enhancing the dApp interface and functionality -** Our development team will work tirelessly to improve the overall quality and functionality of our dApp, aiming to provide an intuitive, seamless, and satisfying user experience that meets the high standards set by our DAO.

This stage is expected to last between 2 to 4 months. 💰 During this period, users can safely invest and earn rewards without any limitations.

## **Transitioning to the v1 Release**

Upon completing major upgrades and improvements, we will deploy **the v1 Release**. Ideally, this transition will be smooth and unnoticeable for users. However, there may be instances where significant features require deploying a new version of the protocol. In such cases, the old version will remain accessible, but users will need to transfer their funds to the new version to utilize the new features. As only users have access to their funds, we cannot perform this transfer on their behalf.

## **Community Involvement and Feedback**

During the public beta test, we encourage our community to actively participate by providing feedback, reporting bugs, and suggesting improvements. 🗣️ By doing so, you will play a crucial role in shaping the final version of our protocol, ensuring it meets the needs and expectations of all users. We may even offer incentives and rewards for valuable contributions that help improve the protocol. 🏅

Your insights and suggestions can be shared on our [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/8mcUPPYJmj) or other community channels. Together, we can build a robust, secure, and high-performing yield aggregator that sets new standards in the industry. 🌟
